# synchronization-test
A program designed to see how hard it might be to get an error while using an unsynchronized counter with many threads. The user is able to choose the number of threads and the number of increments each thread will complete.   After all the threads have died, the value of the counter is printed out as well as what the correct count should have been for comparison.
